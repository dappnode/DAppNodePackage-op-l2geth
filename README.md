# DAppNodePackage-op-geth

OP-geth is a minimal fork of the official `go-ethereum`. In the OP environment, OP-geth acts as the Execution Engine, which is responsible for executing the blocks it receives from the rollup node and storing state. It also exposes standard JSON-RPC methods to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network.
